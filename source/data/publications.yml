  abstract:
    In order to detect software risks at an early stage, various software visualization techniques have been developed for monitoring the structure, behaviour, or the underlying development process of software.
    One of greatest risks for any IT organization consists in an inappropriate distribution of knowledge among its developers, as a projects' success mainly depends on assigning tasks to developers with the required skills and expertise.
    In this work, we address this problem by proposing a novel Visual Analytics framework for mining and visualizing the expertise of developers based on their source code activities.
    Under the assumption that a developer's knowledge about code is represented directly through comments and the choice of identifier names, we generate a 2D layout using Latent Dirichlet Allocation together with Multidimensional Scaling on the commit history, thus displaying the semantic relatedness between developers.
    In order to capture a developer's expertise in a concept, we utilize Labeled LDA trained on a corpus of Open Source projects.
    By mapping aspects related to skills onto the visual variables of 3D glyphs, we generate a 2.5D Visualization, we call KnowhowMap.
    We exemplify this approach with an interactive prototype that enables users to analyze the distribution of skills and expertise in an explorative way.

  abstract:
    Based on the assumption that semantic relatedness between documents is reflected in the distribution of the vocabulary, topic models are a widely used technique for different analysis tasks.
    Their application results in concepts, the so-called topics, and a high-dimensional description of the documents.
    For visualization tasks, they can further be projected onto a lower-dimensional space using a dimension reduction technique.
    Though the quality of the resulting scatter plot mainly depends on the chosen layout technique and the choice of its hyperparameters, it is unclear which particular combinations of topic models and dimension reduction techniques are suitable for displaying the semantic relatedness between the documents.
    In this work, we propose a benchmark comprising various datasets, layout techniques, and quality metrics for conducting an empirical study on different such layout algorithms.

  abstract:
    For various program comprehension tasks, software visualization techniques can be beneficial by displaying aspects related to the behavior, structure, or evolution of software. 
    In many cases, the question is related to the semantics of the source code files, e.g., the localization of files that implement specific features or the detection of files with similar semantics. 
    This work presents a general software visualization technique for source code documents, which uses 3D glyphs placed on a two-dimensional reference plane. 
    The relative positions of the glyphs captures their semantic relatedness. 
    Our layout originates from applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Multidimensional Scaling on the comments and identifier names found in the source code files. 
    Though different variants for 3D glyphs can be applied, we focus on cylinders, trees, and avatars. 
    We discuss various mappings of data associated with source code documents to the visual variables of 3D glyphs for selected use cases and provide details on our visualization system.
